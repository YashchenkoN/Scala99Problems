# Solutions for S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems

There are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied
Sciences in Berne, Switzerland. Phil Gold have altered them to be more amenable to programming in Scala.

The problems have different levels of difficulty.

This project is only my implementation of solutions. I write it during Scala learning.

## Running the tests

In the future, I will write tests for all problems, but currently tests are in TODO stage
